# Enhancing Large Language Model Performance via Fine-tuning and Prompt Engineering

This repository presents a comprehensive framework to improve the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) using **fine-tuning techniques** and **advanced prompt engineering strategies**. The project aims to demonstrate how targeted adaptation and optimized prompting can significantly enhance the quality, relevance, and control of language model outputs in real-world applications.

## 📌 Objectives

- Improve the accuracy and alignment of LLM outputs for domain-specific tasks.
- Compare performance between base models, prompt-tuned models, and fine-tuned models.
- Evaluate cost-performance tradeoffs between prompt engineering and fine-tuning.
- Provide reusable templates and implementation code for deploying enhanced LLMs.
